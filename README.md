Interview task for City of Baltimore - Data Fellow position


## Question
It is important for the City of Baltimore to provide services efficiently and equitably to residents. A key performance indicator (KPI) for many city services is on time completion (completing work within the timeframe that the city government agency has committed to for that particular service type). Baltimore’s City Bureau of Solid Waste would like to assess the performance of a number of core cleanliness-related  services (“SR Type”) that they are responsible for; specifically Cleaning, Boarding, High Grass and Weeds (HGW), Dirty Streets, and Dirty Alleys. Please ignore any services labeled as “proactive”, or statuses containing the strings "duplicate" or "transfer". 

Imagine that you are an Analyst within the Bureau of Solid Waste. Please write a memo to the Director of the Bureau that addresses the following questions using the dataset “311_CSR” provided and filtering to only include work created from January 1, 2017- December 31, 2019:
 - For each type of service request, how many service requests were created each year from 2017-2019?
 - How did the on-time % change over time? Please use a rolling 90 day average.
 - What % of service requests created in 2019 were completed past the due date? 
 - Using the information calculated above and other information from the dataset, can you provide evidence to determine if service requests created in 2019 are being completed equitably across the city? 
 - You may also provide any additional insights that you found while exploring the data.
